# Use cases of Equia Python SDK

This repository contains a collection of samples showcasing some typical uses of [Equia Python SDK](https://vlxe.com/).

> All samples use Python 3.10.

## What is Equia?

Equia is the cloud version of VLXE. It supports all the calculations and systems from the Excel version of VLXE but also much more.
[Equia Python SDK](https://vlxe.com/features) integrates the Equia platform by letting you write code that invokes functionality exposed by OnlinePVT API.
